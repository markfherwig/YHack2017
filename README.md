# YHack2019
In December 2019 Austin Liu, Shyrans Goyal, and I travelled to Yale from Rice. Our goal for this hackathon was to use machine learning to predict the price of bitcoin based off of social media posts.
We were scraping forums such as wallstreetbets early on before they became popular for profitting off the short sale bubble of GameStop and AMC. I still believe there is value in certain internet
forums and am interested in revisiting this code one day.
